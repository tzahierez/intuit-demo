# intuit-demo

installation and run:

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java

the project is not 100% complete for the capacity and time limitation.
the project contains a component test that validates the flow (with mock external systems).

several compromises are marked with "// TODO" comment.
the main thing is that the implemented service doesnt really merge the data. it fetches the data, and when it being requested, it can be filtered properly. (or maintained in the database. there can be few approches for this)
